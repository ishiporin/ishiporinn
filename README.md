## About me 🧾

Hello, I don't like my real-name so please refer to me as my stage-name (Akihiko Fujimori / 明彦 藤森).
I'm a junior front-end developer currently talking from Brazil, I'm 16 years old and I started to code when I was 15, it wasn't a that long time but  I have some experience with front-end, UI and UX Design. I've never worked as a developer before so I don't have any job experience but I'll be posting my projects here as my portfolio. You can talk to me in English, 日本語, and Portugues (Brasil). In addition to being a junior programmer, I have been a music producer for 4 years, producing Future Bass and other EDM styles. I'm pretty social but only at messages, I can't talk properly on video calls, calls and even in person. That's all for now and that's me, feel free to message me on Discord so we can chat and maybe play some games, also, please call me ishiporin, Akihiko only for those closest to me.
