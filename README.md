## About me 🧾

Hello, I am Laura, a trans girl.
I'm a junior front-end developer currently talking from Brazil, I'm 16 years old and I started to code when I was 15, it wasn't a that long time but  I have some experience with front-end, UI and UX Design. I've never worked as a developer before so I don't have any job experience but I'll be posting my projects here as my portfolio. You can talk to me in English, 日本語, and Portuguese (Brazil). In addition to being a junior programmer, I have been a music producer for 4 years, producing Future Bass and other EDM styles. I'm pretty social but only at messages, I can't talk properly on video calls, calls and even in person. That's all for now and that's me.
